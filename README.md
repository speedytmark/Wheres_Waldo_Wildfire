  1) Image classification to attempt to find Where's Waldo.
  2) Create a custom built CNN to classify images of wildfire. 

## Abstract
The team explored the limitations, challenges and capabilities of convolutional neural networks (CNN) by working through an image classification problem.  
We began by testing various machine learning and deep learning methods on a Where’s Waldo dataset of illustrations. An extremely small number of samples for Waldo images tested the learning capacity and limits of even the most capable neural nets (ie ResNet). After applying a variety of data cleansing and augmentation techniques and a range of reference models, the team was forced to abandon the dataset. The lack of readily available data hindered our reference model’s ability to learn and generalize this challenging problem. However, we worked out clear requirements and framework for an image classification problem.  
The team repeated the process and developed a custom convolutional neural network that identified the presence of fire in an image, using a wildfire dataset. With balanced, complete data and very clear differences in the two classes, the team iteratively built a simple and efficient CNN that performed with a high level of accuracy.
